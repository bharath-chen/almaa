              At <strong>Almaa Herbals</strong>, we respect the right to privacy
              of every individual. The friendship with you is the greatest asset
              and is the very core of our name and reputation.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              We understand the importance you attach to the privacy and
              security of information that specifically identifies you or
              information about your account. We refer to and take care of this
              information as “personal information”.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              In limited circumstances where we agree in good faith that
              disclosure is required by law, to comply with regulators or law
              enforcement authorities, or to protect our rights or properties,
              we reserve the right to reveal or report personal information.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              We use personal information in ways that are consistent with the
              purposes for which we originally requested that information. For
              instance, we will use the information you give us to process your
              requests and transactions, to provide you with additional product
              and service information. We can share your personal information
              with an agent or affiliate to do so.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              We restrict the collection and use of personal information to what
              is required to run our company and provide you with superior
              service. This may include advising you about our products or
              services, our affiliates' products, and other opportunities we
              believe may be of interest to you. We can combine information you
              offer us on the Web or via other channels to serve you better.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              When we share personal information with an employer or partner,
              with a strict confidentiality agreement, we protect the personal
              information. Companies we employ to provide support services or
              serve as our representative must abide by our principles of
              privacy.

              The corporate policies of Almaa Herbals require that employees
              with access to confidential customer information may not use or
              disclose the information except for use in business. All employees
              are required to protect such information, as set out in their
              Almaa Herbals confidentiality agreements.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              We may, on occasions, assist a business not affiliated with Almaa
              Herbals in providing or offering you a product or service. In such
              cases, marketing materials will include guidance on how to
              recommend that these messages not be received in the future. In
              any case, a strict confidentiality agreement will protect your
              personal information.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              We will not allow any non-affiliated company to retain your
              personal information longer than necessary to provide the product,
              service, or information, unless you affirmatively authorize us to
              do so.

              We continue to assess our efforts to protect personal information
